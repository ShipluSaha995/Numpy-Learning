# Numpy is the fundamental packedge or core python library for scientific computing or numerical computing in python.
# it is much faster and more memory efficient.

'''
Numpy Array: A numpy array is a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data,
how to locate an element and how to interpret an element.

We can also say that it is a collection of the elements of same data-type.

key point:

--> Stored in conteguous memory  
--> Can be 1 dimensional, 2 dimensional and multi-dimensional  
--> Optimized for fast mathematical operations

# Difference between Numpy Array and Python list 

'''
1. Consumes less memory than  python lists
2. Fast as compared to the Pyhton lists
3. Store same data-type but Python lists can store different data-types
4. Numpy array supports vectorized operations but lists requires loop
